## Setup Instructions for ROS gym environment.
To use the NoVNC script for remote visualization of your simulations, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using SSH(HTTP will not grant you access for direct commits)
```bash
git clone "git@github.com:uci-f1tenth/uci_f1tenth_workshop.git"
```

Go into the gym directory you installed the program in.
```bash
cd uci-f1tenth-workshop/f1tenth_gym_ros
```

Run shell script:
```bash
sh scripts/run.sh
```

Open a web browser and go to link
```bash
http://localhost:8080/vnc.html
```

Run the ROS within the VM hosted in the docker simulator and run
```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source install/local_setup.bash
```

Launch the simulation
```bash
ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py
```

## Building a node
*To build a node in ROS2, you must be within the vm root.
If you are not in the machine either run the script again, or run:
```bash
docker exec -it f1tenth_gym_ros-sim-1 /bin/bash
```

Source two environments under /sim_ws/:
```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
```
Run the build command under with your node name in setup.py
```bash
colcon build --packages-select your_node
```
Source the workspace environment again
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```
Run the node with the executable
```bash
ros2 run your_package your_executable
```

## Example execution of the dreamer node
```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select dreamer_node
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run agents dreamer_agent
```
